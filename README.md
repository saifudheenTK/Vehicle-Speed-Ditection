# Vehicle-Speed-Ditection
vehicle speed estimation using yolo10 and open cv

How It Works?

The process begins with video input. YOLOv10 detects vehicles in each frame. Movement is tracked, with unique IDs. Speed is calculated using pixel displacement. The calculated speed shows on the video feed.

1.Upload video or use webcam (Streamlit).
2.YOLOv10 detects vehicles.
3.Tracks vehicle movement.
4.Calculates speed.
5.Displays speed on video.

## ðŸš— Vehicle Speed Detection App

This app detects vehicle speeds using YOLO and displays real-time tracking.
